# Assigment 5: Testing & CI in Financial Engineering
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-92%25-brightgreen)


A tiny daily backtester with:

* **PriceLoader:** returns a `pandas.Series` of prices for a single symbol (use synthetic data for tests).
* **Strategy:** outputs daily signals (`-1, 0, +1` or booleans) from price history.
* **Broker:** accepts market orders, updates cash/position with no slippage/fees (keep deterministic for tests).
* **Backtester:** runs end-of-day loop: compute signal (t‚àí1), trade at close (t), track cash/position/equity.
